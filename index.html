    <p> <span class="blueColor accent">aiMarketAnalytics.com </span> is the triangle of real-time Market Intelligence social media Monitoring (MIM), the Knowledge Management (KM) and the People Relation Management (PRM) systems.</p>
    <p>The core of the service is a knowledge management system and proprietary NLP ML algorithms. It allows us to accurately recognize the sense and emotional temperature of the text from websites and social networks and ask human-like queries to the system.</p>
    <p>A knowledge Management System is a tool for describing the domain area. It is a set of conceptions, relations and a dictionary of terms. Products with categories and properties are a part of this description.</p>
    <p>Real-time market intelligence social media monitoring is scanners which analyze text data from different external sources of data like websites or social networks. It's a permanent incoming flow of data which requires study, investigation or urgent reaction.</p>
    <p>CRM is traditionally responsible for the loyalty of the external customer, increasing sales, and profitability; improving customer service. But what about our internal customers? About our staff which is a pillar of a business. A clear understanding of official duties; responsibilities; performance and loyalty measurements are crucially important for a business. That's why we call it Customer and Staff Relation Management.</p>
    <p>We are a startup with ambitious plans. The technology we are working on will lead to new standards.</p>
